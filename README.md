# Flappy-Bird
# Flappy Bird Clone in Unity
This project is a clone of the popular Flappy Bird game, built using Unity Hub and C#. It provides a simple yet engaging 2D game where players navigate a bird through obstacles by tapping or clicking to keep it airborne.

# Features
Physics-based Gameplay: The bird's motion is controlled using Unity's physics engine, adding realism and a challenge for the player.
Randomized Obstacles: Each game session generates pipes at random heights to make the gameplay experience unique and unpredictable.
Scoring System: The player's score increments every time they successfully navigate the bird through a set of pipes. The highest score is displayed, and the game keeps track of it.
Collision Detection: The game uses collision detection to determine when the bird hits a pipe or the ground, triggering the game over screen.
User-friendly UI: A clean and intuitive user interface is included, featuring the current score, the highest score, and start/restart buttons.
# Tools & Technologies
Unity Hub: Used to manage Unity versions and open the project.
Unity 2D Engine: Leveraged for creating the game's 2D environment, sprites, physics, and animations.
C# Scripting: Scripts were written in C# to handle gameplay mechanics such as bird movement, score tracking, and obstacle generation.
Unity UI: Used to display in-game scores, game over messages, and buttons for restarting or exiting the game.
Sprite Design: Bird, pipes, and background images are simple 2D sprites designed or imported from free resources.

# Gameplay Instructions
Controls:
Desktop: Use the mouse button or space bar to make the bird jump.
Mobile: Tap the screen to make the bird jump.
Objective: Keep the bird in the air by navigating through the pipes and avoiding collisions.
Score: Every time the bird successfully passes through a pair of pipes, your score increases by 1.
Game Over: The game ends if the bird hits a pipe or falls to the ground.
